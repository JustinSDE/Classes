	Introduction:

	This readme file serves as a simple guide to run the tests I used in my assigment. For python files you will need all dependencies such as sklearn, 

	numpy, matplotlib or any other imported library that is not part of python 2.7. Also, make sure the data files 'letterRecognition.csv' and
	
	'Wdbc.csv' are present
	___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

	
	In the code folder, there are files pertaining to each algorithm and in order to run them, you need to follow the steps under each algorithm below:

	- SVM:
		- is a python file named SupportVectorTests.py
		- make sure to create a folder named SVM in the same directory prior to running the file
		-


     



	*NOTE: In order for the code to function properly, do not remove any of the files from the directory. Also, please make sure to create the output 
	 directories for Each of the algorithms as mentioned above.
