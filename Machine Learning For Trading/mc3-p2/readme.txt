MC3-Project-2: KNN Trader 
_________________________

A) My Project Has 4 files that can be run to generate the required analysis whether: ML4T-220 or IBM; and whether: In sample or out of sample. The files are: 

	
	Knn_trader_ml4t.py , knn_trader_out_sample_ml4t.py , Knn_trader_IBM.py , knn_trader_out_sample_IBM.py

 
B) To run any of the above files, please ensure that all submitted files are included in the directory and just run the script.


C) The files will save all related figures in the same directory where the figures are:
	
	1. price vs. predicted price, vs. actual future price
	2. Entry and Exit plot
	3. Backtest Plot

 
D)  Also, the sript will print:

	1. the rmse error of the knn learner
	2. the correlation of the knn learner
	3. the profit of the portfolio where it is (the final portfolio value - the entry value)


E) Please make sure that these files are in a folder called 'mc3-p2' that is inside a folder 'ml4t'. 
   
   Also, the 'data' folder should be placed in the 'ml4t' folder
